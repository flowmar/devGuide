# devGuide

---

We want everyone to create projects that are easily accessed and used by others in the developer community! Quite often, we as developers stumble upon code repositories which would be quite useful in practice, yet are lacking in appropriate documentation of the code, rendering the code essentially useless. On the other side of the fence, it can be challenging to keep up with all aspects of a program as it's being developed; by the time the code is complete, it can easy to leave out details in your documentation.

Our application will guide you through the process of creating a new project, ensuring that you hit all the steps necessary for your project to be effectively organized and shared with others. By the end of the process, you will have all the information you need, in a concise format from which you can create one of the most important aspects of any software -- the documentation.
