Welcome to DevGuide! We created this application to help new (and veteran!) developers ensure that they create projects that are carefully planned, version controlled, documented and complete. Our goal is to enforce project best practices by providing a guided walkthrough of the software development lifecycle, alongside useful resources for each step.
